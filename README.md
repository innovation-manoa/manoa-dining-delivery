# Manoa Dining Delivery

## About
Meal plans at UH manoa come in either 7, 10, 14 or 19(?) meals a week along with "meal points" which are essentially cash credits put in your account (1 point = $1) that are reladed once a semester.
Meals do not roll-over to the next week if you do not spend them all. Meal points, however, do roll-over to the spring semester if you do not spend it in the fall. 

You can spend 1 meal at either Gateway Cafeteria or Hale Aloha Cafeteria for all you can eat. 
There is a "take-out" option at the cafeterias where you can spend $0.50 more to get a box that you can fill up with food (no limit).
If you do not want to eat at either of the cafeterias (or they are closed) you can exchange a meal for $5.50 credit at various places on campus including: The Market, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Stirfresh, and Campus center cafeteria (or whatever its called).

## The problem we are trying to solve: 
1. By the end of each week, many people have tons of meals left over and are forced to spend their meals at the market (which is essentially a 7/11) on food they dont really want. If given the opportunity many of those people would exchange their meals for cash. 
2. Many people who are busy studying (or being lazy) would rather have food delivered to them than have to go all the way to the cafeteria to get food. If given the opportunity to get food delivered to them for a small amount, they would definitely do so.

The idea of Manoa Dining delivery is to allow students who live at the UH dorms to spend their meals in exchange for cash. 

## How it works:
- User goes on our web app
- Verifies that they are UH student (CAS)
- They will have a profile set up for them associated with their authenticated account (if there is a way to do this). This will have: first and last name at the very minimum.
- Decides whether they want to deliver or get food delivered

### If they want to get food delivered:
- Choose the dorm they are at (maybe have saved settings?) along with room number
- Choose where they want to get food from
- They are given a menu (with checkboxes for each item) 
- They choose what they want and have the option to put a special request.
- click submit and wait for their request to be picked up
- notified if someone has chosen to get their food delivered.
- pay upon receiving food

### If they want to deliver:
- They are given a list of people who want to get food delivered (real-time). This will show Name, Dorm they are at, name of place they want food from, rating
	- example: | Terry | Frear Hall | Hale Aloha | 5/5 | 
- They choose who they want to deliver to
- They are then shown their order
	- example: steak, burger, pizza, fries, lemonade, special requests: little bit of fries
- They deliver and are paid in cash
