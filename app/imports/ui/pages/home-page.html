        <h1>What is Manoa Dining Delivery?</h1>
        <p>Mānoa Dining Delivery is a service where students at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (dorming or non dorming) can make a request for food from one of the two cafeterias and have the food delivered to them. Students who have extra meals left over can decide whether they want to donate the meal swipe or collect a small fee.</p>

        <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
        <p>When a student wants to send out a request, all they need to do is sign in to the application with their UH email and password. Then they simply fill out a form with their information and dorm location (or location on campus). Students can then view requests and fulfill them.</p>
        <p>Students can choose which items they would like from the menu, ranging from salads, entrees, deserts, and more! When the student arrives to the dorm with the food the requestee will then pay the deliveree the $1 charge (and tip if they so desire). After that you can enjoy your food without having to actually walk to the cafe!</p>
