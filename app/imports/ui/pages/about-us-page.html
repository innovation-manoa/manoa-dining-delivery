          <h2>What is Mānoa Dining Delivery?</h2>
          <p id="aboutUs">
            Meal plans at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa come in either 7, 10, 14 or 19 meals a week along with
            “meal
            points”, which are essentially cash credits put in your account (1 point = $1) that are reloaded once a
            semester. For students living at the dormitories, it is mandatory to have a meal plan. Meal swipes refresh
            every Sunday and many students do not use all their meals by the end of the week. At the end of the week
            (Saturday) many students go to The Market, a on-campus convinience store, to spend the rest of their weekly
            meals on food or things they do not necessarily want.
          </p>

          <p id="aboutUs"> Mānoa Dining Delivery tries to solve this problem by allowing students to essentially "trade"
            their meal
            swipes for real world cash. With this service, students are able to send out a request for food from one of
            the two on campus cafeterias. Students with extra meal swipes are able to fulfill requests by going to the
            cafe, spending a meal swipe, filling up a takeout box with food and delivering the food to the requestee.
